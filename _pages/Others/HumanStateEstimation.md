The complexity of the robot system is highly affected by the number of actuators. For this reason, several researchers have tried to use less number of actuators than the robot actual degree of freedoms (DoF); these robots and mechanism were named as <i> under-actuated robots </i> and <i>under-actuation mechanism</i>, respectively.

Among various transmissions used in the under-actuated robots, the tendon transmission 

Among various transmissions used for the under-actuated robots \cite{Birglen2006}, the under-actuated tendon transmission has shown advantages in making the robot compact and light. It is because the tendon is compliant with a small cross-section area, so it can pass through the joints without restrictions. In some researches, Bowden cable has been used to enhance these advantages by locating heavy and bulky components such as the actuators, controllers, and battery far from the robot 

The number of actuator is 

Under-actuated tendon-driven (UATD) robots have advantages in terms of 1) lightweight; 2) compact size; and 3) ability to make adaptive motions against the external environment. However, in UATD robots, friction at the tendons accumulates as they pass through many joints, causing hysteresis and detrimental to tension distribution, reliability and efficiency. For this issue, this paper presents a method to find possible under-actuated tendon routings for the robot that has $n$ fingers; it derives $2^{n+1}-1$ routings for the robot that has $n$ parallel links. This paper also shows validation of the routings with four performance factors (i.e., adaptability, torsional balance, reliability, and efficiency) that are determined by friction. By applying the proposed framework to a specific robot application, a soft hand wearable robot that assists the SCI people, we proved that the proposed framework works effectively improving the performance of the tendon-driven robots as follow: 1) it improves under-actuation performance (the difference in fingertip force reduced from 3.1N  to  1.3N); 2) it reduces hysteresis (the hysteresis in joint angle domain reduced from  81.8\%  to  46.9\%) at the flexor; 3) it enables to use passive tendon; and 4) it enables to attach tension sensor at the end-effector in a compact size. These improvements verify the efficacy of the proposed framework for improving the robot performance.
