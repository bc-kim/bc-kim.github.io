Machine Learning R&D Engineer - Shanghai:
I completed my end-of-study internship in Shanghai as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs. I have been working on Deep-Learning and Advanced Algorithms applied to Pronunciation Evaluation for language learners.

Research Assistant - Daejon (South-Korea):
I have been a volunteer in a Research Laboratory dedicated to Artificial Intelligence AIM where I worked on video classification for the CVPR2017 workshop, especially working on Attention Gated LSTM Cell, in TensorFlow.

Software Engineer Intern - Paris:
I have been an intern at Aerow in Paris, as a Software Engineer and integrator. I have been developing a simple OCR for bankcheques CMC7 code, using simple Machine-Learning techniques.
