About me

I’m currently working at [Soft Robotic Research Center (SRRC)][SRRC_link] in Seoul National University, as a senior researcher, since September 2020.

---
As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.
I got myself into Data Science early in my education and had the chance to get my hands on all kinds of data, from sequential to spatial, images, audio signals, BI data etc.
As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.

You can check about my different projects on my [research][Research_link] page

Previous work experiences
Machine Learning R&D Engineer - Shanghai:
I completed my end-of-study internship in Shanghai as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs. I have been working on Deep-Learning and Advanced Algorithms applied to Pronunciation Evaluation for language learners.

Research Assistant - Daejon (South-Korea):
I have been a volunteer in a Research Laboratory dedicated to Artificial Intelligence AIM where I worked on video classification for the CVPR2017 workshop, especially working on Attention Gated LSTM Cell, in TensorFlow.

Software Engineer Intern - Paris:
I have been an intern at Aerow in Paris, as a Software Engineer and integrator. I have been developing a simple OCR for bankcheques CMC7 code, using simple Machine-Learning techniques.
