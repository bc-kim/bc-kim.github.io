**Trade-off issue **
The compliance of robot is also a well-known factor that affects the robot functionality and usability. In general, the wearable robot can be categorized into 1) rigid wearable robot; and 2) soft wearable robot. The characteristics of these robots are as below:

1. The rigid wearable robots usually have a well-defined kinematic structure. It means that the robots have their own joints. When using the rigid wearable robots, the user can feel uncomfortable or in sever cases, may be injured if the robot joint does not match with the human joint. Therefore it is important to design a joint alignment mechanism that aligns the robot joints with human joints. However, in most of cases, the joint alignment mechanism occupies large volume and harms the robot usability. Although the rigid wearable robot is more complicated and less usable, this kind of robots have advantages in accurate force transmission. Since the kinematic relationship between the robot and the human body is well-defined, we can calculate posture or force applied to the user easily when these robots are used. For this reason, rigid wearable robots are being used well for rehabilitation purposes rather than assisting purposes.

2. The soft wearable robots does not have any kinematic structure. Therefore, the joint alignment mechanism which is used in the rigid wearable robot is not required. For this reason, the soft wearable robots

It is because the robot structure should be well fitted to the human body.

One of the main difficulties in developing the soft hand wearable robot comes from a difficulty in fabrication. 

Exo-Glove Shell


Usability and functionality are both important when designing hand wearable robots, but satisfying both indicators has remained a challenging issue. It is because - due to the limitation of reducing the robot component size and weight - the use of sufficient actuators and sensors harms the usability. Further, robot compliance affects the degree of robot deformation that is related to both indicators; the robot compliance makes the robot fit the user well without considering human kinematics, but sometimes makes the force transmission inaccurate. As a solution for this trade-off issue, this paper presents a tendon-driven hybrid hand wearable robot, named Exo-Glove Thumb. The proposed robot assists the opposition motion, which is known as the most important hand function in daily life, with a minimized number of actuators - i.e., the robot assists the thumb opposition (2 DoF) and the flexion/extension of the index/middle finger (1 DoF), with only four tendon driven actuators, through the proper use of the under-actuation mechanism. Further, the robot has a combined design of the soft robotic body and rigid tendon router modules to achieve both compactness and accurate force transmission. \textcolor{red}{As a result}, the design using soft garment enables the robot to be fitted well to the users without strict customization and additional mechanisms, as other soft wearable robots do. The use of rigid tendon routers makes the robot transmit the force accurately, without the robot deformation. Mechanical performance of the Exo-Glove Thumb shows that the robot covers \textcolor{red}{results}. In user tests, the robot shows the \textcolor{red}{results}
