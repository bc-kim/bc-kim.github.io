  <figcaption>Main Figure: Two main design features of the Exo-Glove Shell: (a) - (d) show the proposed hybrid design that uses a soft garment and rigid metal rings; (e) - (g) show the under-actuated robot design, to assist three primitive motions with only four tendon-driven actuators (a) shows the fabrication process of the robot. The robot is fabricated by attaching metal routers, components to route the tendon, to the router hanger at the glove; (b) and (c) show possible problems that can occur when the robot is not fixed well to the user body; (d) shows the wearing part of the Exo-Glove Shell that was fabricated with both a soft garment and rigid metal ring; (e) shows the specifically designed actuator that enables the use of the under-actuation mechanism without complicating the robot wearing part;(f) shows how the tendons are routed along the glove to enable the desired motions; (g) shows how the tendons are pulled with fewer actuators. </figcaption>

As explained in the [Hybrid wearable robot design page][HWRD_link], in the wearable robot researches, the robot characteristics highly depend on the compliance of the robot component. For this reason, I have tried to use both rigid and soft component in designing the wearable robot; the robot design approach are described in this page. Details of the design approach of the Exo-Glove Shell will be updated after the publication of the paper.
