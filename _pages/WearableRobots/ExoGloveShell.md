**Design approach of the Exo-Glove Shell**
---
As explained in the [Hybrid wearable robot design page][HWRD_link], in the wearable robot researches, the robot characteristics highly depend on the compliance of the robot component. For this reason, I have tried to use both rigid and soft component in designing the wearable robot; the robot design approach are described in this page. Details of the design approach of the Exo-Glove Shell will be updated after the publication of the paper.
