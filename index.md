About me
---

Iâ€™m currently working at [Soft Robotic Research Center (SRRC)][SRRC_link] in Seoul National University, as a senior researcher, since September 2020.
>As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.   I got myself into Data Science early in my education and had the chance to get my hands on all kinds of data, from sequential to spatial, images, audio signals, BI data etc.
As an R&D Engineer, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.

You can check my detail informations on my [about][about_link] page. Also, details of my researches and publications are described on my [research][Research_link] page and [publication][publication_link] page, respectively. 

CV can be downloaded from [here][cv_link].
