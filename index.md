About me
---
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, working with [Professor Kyu-jin Cho][Lab_link] in department of Mechanical engineering. I am currently working on tendon-driven soft wearable robot and tendon transmissions in [Soft Robotic Research Center (SRRC)][SRRC_link], since September 2020. 

>I have been researching the enabling technologies necessary for robots to be used in real life, not in a laboratory. More specifically, I aimed to solve the trade-off issue between the robot performance and the robot compexity. This is because the high price and complexity of the robot elememts (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers) are the main reasons that makes robots difficult to use in real life. As a robotic researcher -- since I believe that the convergence of multi-disciplines is the most important key for successful robot that can be used in real life -- I am looking forward to collaborating with researchers in various fields.

You can check my detail informations on my [about][about_link] page. Also, details of my researches and publications are described on my [research][Research_link] page and [publication][publication_link] page, respectively. For any inquires, you can reach me via email: [kbc1990@snu.ac.kr][email]
