**About me**
---

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [MIT CSAIL][Lab_MIT_Link] working with Professor Daniela Rus, since Jan 2023. In CSAIL, I am currently developing tendon-driven soft robots with computational co-design framework. Before joining MIT, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Soft Robotic Research Center (SRRC) in Seoul National University (SNU), working with [Professor Kyu-jin Cho][Lab_link](Department of Mechanical engineering, SNU).

>I have been studying the enabling technologies necessary for robots to be used in real life, not in a laboratory. More specifically, I aimed to solve the trade-off issue between the robot performance and the robot complexity. This is because the high price and complexity of the robot elements (e.g., sensors, actuators, controllers) are the main reasons that make robots difficult to use in real life. As a robotic researcher – since I believe that the convergence of multi-disciplines is the most important key for a successful robot that can be used in real life – I am looking forward to collaborating with researchers in various fields.
